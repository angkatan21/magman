magman - "Magazine Manager"
===========================
magman is a tutorial application developed in the article "ATK - A Business Framework" by Ivo Jansch, published under the same name in the September 2008 issue of php|architect.

A reprint of the original article is available at [dalescott.net](http://www.dalescott.net/achievo-atk-mediawiki/index.php/ATK_-_A_Business_Framework#Adding_the_Issue_to_Article_Relationship) (published with permission from the author).

To Get Started
==============
Refer to either the original article or the [tutorial article reprint](http://www.dalescott.net/achievo-atk-mediawiki/index.php/ATK_-_A_Business_Framework#Adding_the_Issue_to_Article_Relationship).

Communication Channels
======================
ATK developers discuss problems and solutions, keep each other informed, and generally help each other out, on the [Achievo/ATK forum](http://forum.achievo.org/). Please consider creating a free user profile on the forum; you will need a user profile to post or reply (viewing does not require a profile). Having a profile also enables you to be sent an email notice when someone replies to one of your posts (or creates a new post), and color-codes posts to show the ones you haven't read yet.

If you create a new forum topic, be careful to submit it to the ATK forum.

Documentation
